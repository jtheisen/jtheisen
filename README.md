Hi, Iâ€™m @jtheisen,

conservative IT-freelancer and entrepreneur.

I'm German, but culturally I feel more at home in the English-speaking world - something that is only possible thanks to modern technology.

Being passionate about the way technology transforms society I hope to be able to contribute to this marvellous trend.

My tech stack these days is based mostly on .NET and Javascript hosted on Azure.
